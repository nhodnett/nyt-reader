# Take home challenge: NYT Reader

## Overview:
This is an application that displays articles from the NY Times Top Stories API. A user has the ability to see all the top stories, or filter by catergory. If an article is of particular interest, the user can click an article to see more details about it.

This application was built as a take home challenge from the Mod 4 curriculum at Turing School of Software & Design and was completed over the duration of 8 hours.
